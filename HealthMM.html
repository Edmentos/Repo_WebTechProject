<p class="left">There are several potential health benefits of using a vape (electronic cigarette) instead of smoking cigarettes.
     Reduced exposure to harmful <b>chemicals</b> vapes do not produce smoke, and the vapor they produce contains significantly fewer harmful chemicals than cigarette smoke
     . This means that using a vape can expose you to fewer harmful chemicals and potentially reduce your risk of <b>smoking-related</b> diseases.

<p class="right">Smoking cigarettes can damage your respiratory system and increase your risk of lung diseases such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis. 
    Vaping, on the other hand, has been shown to have a positive effect on respiratory health, potentially reducing the risk of these diseases.
    Smoking cigarettes can stain your teeth, cause bad breath, and increase your risk of gum disease. 
    Vaping, on the other hand, does not produce smoke, which means it does not cause these oral health problems.
